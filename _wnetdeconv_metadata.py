"""Build-time provider that decides wnetdeconv's runtime dependencies.

``nanobind-backend`` is needed only by a *split-mode* build of ``wnetdeconv_cpp``.
CMakeLists.txt selects split mode for the CPython interpreters and platforms the
backend actually publishes wheels for, and falls back to a linked (``NB_STATIC``)
build everywhere else: PyPy, musl targets (the backend has no musllinux wheel
*and* no sdist), 32-bit Windows (it has no win32 wheel either), and
free-threaded CPython before 3.15, which predates the backend's ``abi3t``
wheels. A linked build embeds nanobind and needs nothing extra at run time.

No PEP 508 marker can express "not a free-threaded interpreter", so this
requirement cannot live in a static ``[project.dependencies]``: declaring it
there makes resolution fail outright on free-threaded CPython 3.14, before a
compiler is ever reached, and building from the sdist is the *only* install path
those interpreters have. So the requirement is decided here, against the
interpreter doing the build.

``WNET_NB_LINKED=ON`` also forces a linked build, and is deliberately not
considered here: it exists for local sanitizer and debug builds, never for
distributable wheels, and an unused requirement on an interpreter the backend
does support is harmless.

Wired up in pyproject.toml as::

    [[tool.dynamic-metadata]]
    provider = { path = ".", module = "_wnetdeconv_metadata" }

That is the standard top-level table (the dynamic-metadata 0.3 spec), not the
``[tool.scikit-build.metadata.<field>]`` one this used to use: scikit-build-core
deprecated that in 1.0 and warns on every build that uses it. The inline
``{path, module}`` form is how a *local* in-project provider is named here -- a
bare import string is only accepted for a plugin registered under the
``dynamic_metadata.provider`` entry-point group. ``experimental`` is no longer
required either; that gate only ever covered the deprecated table.

The two forms cannot both be present (scikit-build-core errors out), and
``scikit-build-core>=1.0`` is pinned in ``[build-system] requires`` because an
older backend would ignore this table and silently ship a wheel that declares no
dependencies at all.

    is on musl -- and it fails later and far more confusingly, because a
    split-mode win32 wheel *builds* and only refuses to install, on the very
    platform it was built for. pylmcf 1.2.0 published one.

    Note this is deliberately not ``sys.platform == "win32"``, which is true on
    64-bit Windows as well and would drop every Windows build out of split mode.
    ``sysconfig.get_platform()`` is where the wheel's platform tag comes from,
    and it separates ``win32`` from ``win-amd64`` and ``win-arm64``. Like
    is_musl() the test is one-sided: no non-Windows platform reports ``win32``.

    Every package in the stack must agree on this, not just avoid a broken
    wheel: if one falls back to linked on win32 while another stays split, the
