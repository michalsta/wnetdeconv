"""Build-time provider that decides wnetdeconv's runtime dependencies.

``nanobind-backend`` is needed only by a *split-mode* build of ``wnetdeconv_cpp``.
CMakeLists.txt selects split mode for the CPython interpreters and platforms the
backend actually publishes wheels for, and falls back to a linked (``NB_STATIC``)
build everywhere else: PyPy, musl targets (the backend has no musllinux wheel
*and* no sdist), and free-threaded CPython before 3.15, which predates the
backend's ``abi3t`` wheels. A linked build embeds nanobind and needs nothing
extra at run time.

No PEP 508 marker can express "not a free-threaded interpreter", so this
requirement cannot live in a static ``[project.dependencies]``: declaring it
there makes resolution fail outright on free-threaded CPython 3.14, before a
compiler is ever reached, and building from the sdist is the *only* install path
those interpreters have. So the requirement is decided here, against the
interpreter doing the build.

``WNET_NB_LINKED=ON`` also forces a linked build, and is deliberately not
considered here: it exists for local sanitizer and debug builds, never for
distributable wheels, and an unused requirement on an interpreter the backend
does support is harmless.

Wired up in pyproject.toml as::

    [tool.scikit-build]
    experimental = true          # required for a non-scikit-build-core plugin

    [tool.scikit-build.metadata.dependencies]
    provider = "_wnetdeconv_metadata"
    provider-path = "."

Note the table: scikit-build-core reads providers from *its own* namespace,
keyed by the field they supply. A top-level ``[[tool.dynamic-metadata]]`` entry
is silently ignored, which leaves ``dynamic = ["dependencies"]`` resolving to
nothing and ships a wheel that declares no dependencies at all.
